//^2. What is template literals in Javascript?
/*
  When we combine $ sign {}brackets and backticks (``). It helps to embed
  variable and expression direcly to the string to makin the code 
  more readable and flexible

  example:-
  let a = 10;
  let b = 20;

//^3. What is hositing ? Give an example.

greet();

function greet() {
  console.log("Hii there ðŸ‘‹");
}

/*
 so in above we accessing the funtion before declaring in other langauge
 like python so, it will throw an error.
 --- But in JS it will execute and print the code. So this phenomena is 
 know as hoisting
